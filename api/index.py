"""Vercel entrypoint.

Vercel serves any module-level ASGI application named `app` found in a file
under /api. The FastAPI app itself lives in backend/, which is not on the path
of the serverless bundle, so we add it here.

`vercel.json` sets `"framework": null` on purpose: without it Vercel would
detect FastAPI in requirements.txt, activate the Python framework preset, and a
preset takes precedence over file-based functions — the rewrite to /api/index
would stop meaning anything.
